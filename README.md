# spotify-clone-
A front-end Spotify clone built using only HTML &amp; CSS. This project replicates Spotify’s web player UI with a responsive layout, sidebar, navigation, playlists, and footer controls. No JavaScript used—perfect for practicing semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and clean UI design.
